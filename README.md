<h1>Case:</h1>

Your task is to simulate the operation of a nearby slaughterhouse. In one end of the slaughterhouse living
animals arrive and in the other end various products, consisting of one or more animal parts, depart. The
slaughterhouse has three stations where smaller parts of the whole process take place.
1. At the first station, the animals arrive, are weighed and registered.
2. At the second station, the animals are cut into smaller parts. Each part is weighed and registered,
including a reference to which animal it comes from.
The parts are put into trays with each tray containing only one type of parts. Each tray has a maximum
weight capacity.
3. At the third station, products are packed for distribution. One product might be a package with a
number of the same kind of parts intended for repackaging in supermarkets. Another kind of product
might be “half an animal” where all the expected parts are included, but not necessarily coming from
the same animal. All products are registered including references back to the trays the parts came from.
If it is later discovered, that there is some kind of trouble with a slaughtered animal, it should be possible to
recall all products, which might contain parts of the animal. This function should be accessible outside the
slaughterhouse.
It is important for the customer that the stations can work as independently as possible. In particular, Work
shouldn’t stop at a station just because the network is down.

Part 1
This part is about making the above description more precise and designing the architecture of system.
Hand in.
–A domain model of the slaughterhouse
–An architectural overview of the system. Focus on the types of communication (direct/indirect etc.), not
technology. This should not be UML. Use whatever style you prefer. You can image search “architectural
overview” for inspiration.
–A Threat model for the slaughterhouse
